The light of my life  
From me taken away  
In a blink of an eye  
Has destroyed my day  
  
A month, or many to come  
In a day that never ends  
It broke me in the core  
In a way I never felt before  
  
The struggle is real  
Mind fighting the heart  
Will I go mad  
Just because we depart?  
  
I walk wn a road alone  
Drowning in my fears  
Isolated from the world within my mind  
This has been one of the darkest places of the earth

Up on the hills  
Under the eyes  
of wolves and vampires  
A glint of moonshine  
in between rain and snow  
Fearless he fights  
while countles hordes arrive  

He's the one  
you never thought would come for you  
Your fear and disbelief  
won't make him weaker  
but your faith  
created something divine  

A dozen vampires he turned to ashes  
and even after he went down  
his swords keept fighting  

When the night meets the down  
One will stand, one will fall  

Many passed by  
But he was the only to bring the light  

In the darkest night  
Into the castle he went  
Surrounded by the count's wives  
Being proud of what he represent  

A light to shine  
A beacon of hope  
He is the man who cannot die
